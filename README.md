# Datamining Classification Algorithm (ID3)
In decision tree learning, ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) is an algorithm that is used to generate a decision tree from a dataset. ID3 is the precursor to the C4.5 algorithm, and is typically used in the machine learning and natural language processing domains.

# To exceute ID3 algorithm
  1. Make sure you have installed Jupyter Notebook (To install jupyter notebook: http://jupyter.org/install)
  2. Download the repository
  3. Open Jupyter Notebook
  4. Browse to the repository in Jupyter Notebook
  5. Open ID3.ipynb
  3. Make sure that the "dataset" folder is in the source folder
  4. Click on "Cell" -> "Run All"  to execute the code in Jupyter Note
